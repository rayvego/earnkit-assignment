# Local Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up the EarnKit monorepo on your local machine. The project is managed using `pnpm` workspaces.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rayvego/earnkit-assignment.git
cd earnkit-assignment
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Next, install all the necessary dependencies for the entire monorepo. `pnpm` will automatically handle linking the workspaces (`earnkit-sdk`, `web`, `example-agent`).

```bash
pnpm install
```

## 3. Set Up Environment Variables

The project requires several environment variables to run correctly. You will need to create a `.env.local` file in both the `apps/web` and `apps/example-agent` directories.

### a. EarnKit Dashboard App (`apps/web`)

Create a file at `apps/web/.env.local` and add the following variables. You will need a Privy App ID and a PostgreSQL database connection string.

```bash
# Get these from your Privy dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=your_privy_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_CLIENT_ID=your_privy_app_client_id
PRIVY_SECRET=your_privy_secret
PRIVY_VERIFICATION_KEY=your_privy_verification_key

# Connection string for your PostgreSQL database
# Example: postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

### b. Example Agent App (`apps/example-agent`)

Create a file at `apps/example-agent/.env.local` and add the following. You will need to create two agents in your EarnKit developer dashboard to get their IDs.

```bash
# Get this from your Privy dashboard (can be the same as above)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=your_privy_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_CLIENT_ID=your_privy_app_client_id
PRIVY_SECRET=your_privy_secret
PRIVY_VERIFICATION_KEY=your_privy_verification_key

# Get this from the Gemini AI dashboard
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Create two agents in the EarnKit dashboard and get their IDs
NEXT_PUBLIC_FREE_TIER_AGENT_ID=agent_id_for_free_tier_model
NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDIT_BASED_AGENT_ID=agent_id_for_credit_based_model
```

## 4. Set Up the Database

The backend service requires a PostgreSQL database. Once you have your `DATABASE_URL` set, you need to run the Prisma migrations to set up the schema.

Execute the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

This command will apply all necessary migrations and ensure your database schema is up to date.

## 5. Run the Applications

You can run both the main web app and the example agent app concurrently.

### Run the EarnKit Dashboard (`web`):

```bash
pnpm --filter web dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Run the Example Agent (`example-agent`):

```bash
pnpm --filter example-agent dev
```

The example agent will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

You are now fully set up to run and test the EarnKit platform locally!
