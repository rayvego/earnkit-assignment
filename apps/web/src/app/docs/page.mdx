# Introduction

Welcome to the EarnKit documentation!

EarnKit is a monetization toolkit designed to help developers effortlessly add usage-based billing to their AI agents. Whether you want to offer a free trial, charge per use, or implement a sophisticated credit system, EarnKit provides the backend, SDK, and developer dashboard to get you up and running in minutes.

## The Core Problem

Monetizing AI agents is complex. You need to:
- Securely process micro-transactions without high gas fees.
- Handle different pricing models (e.g., subscriptions, pay-as-you-go).
- Prevent users from being charged for failed AI responses.
- Provide a seamless top-up experience for end-users.
- Track usage and revenue.

## The EarnKit Solution

EarnKit solves these problems with a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture and a simple, powerful SDK.

- **Off-Chain Speed:** All per-prompt charges happen off-chain in our database for instant, gas-free transactions.
- **On-Chain Security:** User top-ups are standard on-chain transactions (e.g., ETH on Base Sepolia) sent directly to your developer wallet.
- **Reliable Billing:** Our `track`/`capture`/`release` flow ensures users are only billed for successful AI operations.
- **Developer Dashboard:** Manage your agents, configure fee models, and view usage logs all in one place.

## How to Get Started

- **[Local Setup](./local-setup):** Clone the repo and run the project locally.
- **[SDK Reference](./sdk-reference):** Dive into the SDK's methods and see detailed code examples.

## What is EarnKit?

EarnKit is a TypeScript SDK that enables developers to add usage-based monetization to their AI agents with just a few lines of code. This project demonstrates a complete implementation featuring smart wallet integration, multiple fee models, and comprehensive developer tools.

### Core Features

- **Simple Integration**: Add monetization with `track()`, `capture()`, and `release()` methods
- **Flexible Fee Models**: Support for free tiers and credit-based systems
- **Reliable Billing**: Provisional charging with capture/release pattern prevents failed transactions
- **Smart Wallet Integration**: Seamless payment processing via Privy wallets on Base Sepolia
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor usage, balances, and transactions in real-time
- **Developer Dashboard**: Comprehensive management interface for agents and analytics

## Architecture Overview

This monorepo showcases EarnKit through three integrated applications:

### 1. EarnKit SDK (`packages/earnkit-sdk`)

A lightweight TypeScript SDK providing:

```typescript
// Initialize SDK with agent configuration
const earnkit = new EarnKit({ agentId: "your-agent-id" });

// Track a billable event (provisional charge)
const { eventId } = await earnkit.track({ 
  walletAddress: "0x...",
  creditsToDeduct: 10 // optional for credit-based models
});

try {
  // Your AI logic here...
  const result = await processAIRequest();
  
  // Finalize the charge on success
  await earnkit.capture({ eventId });
} catch (error) {
  // Refund on failure
  await earnkit.release({ eventId });
}

// Check user balances
const balance = await earnkit.getBalance({ walletAddress: "0x..." });

// Handle top-ups for credit-based models
const options = await earnkit.getTopUpDetails();
await earnkit.submitTopUpTransaction({ txHash, walletAddress, amountInEth });
```

**Key Methods:**
- `track()` - Provisionally charge for usage (checks funds, creates pending event)
- `capture()` - Finalize charge after successful AI operation
- `release()` - Refund provisional charge if operation fails
- `getBalance()` - Retrieve user's ETH and credit balances
- `getTopUpDetails()` - Get available purchase options
- `submitTopUpTransaction()` - Process credit purchases

### 2. Developer Dashboard (`apps/web`)

A Next.js application featuring:

- **Agent Management**: Create and configure agents with different fee models
- **Real-time Analytics**: View usage statistics, revenue, and user activity
- **Transaction Logs**: Monitor all events with timestamps, fees, and wallet addresses
- **API Integration**: Secure endpoints for all SDK operations

**Database Models:**
- **Developers**: Authenticated via Privy with deposit wallet addresses
- **Agents**: Configurable fee models and pricing strategies
- **User Balances**: Per-agent ETH and credit balances for each wallet
- **Usage Events**: Detailed logging of all billable events with status tracking
- **Top-up Transactions**: Blockchain transaction monitoring and confirmation

### 3. Example Agent (`apps/example-agent`)

A live demonstration chat application showcasing both fee models:

- **Gemini AI Integration**: Real AI responses powered by Google's Gemini API
- **Live Billing**: Actual SDK integration with real-time balance updates
- **Two Fee Models**: Switch between free tier and credit-based pricing
- **Wallet Connection**: Privy integration for seamless user experience

## Fee Models Implemented

### Free Tier Model

Perfect for freemium AI applications:

```json
{
  "threshold": 50,
  "rate": "0.0001"
}
```

- **Free Usage**: First 50 prompts per wallet are free
- **Pay-per-use**: 0.0001 ETH per prompt after threshold
- **Automatic Billing**: Seamless transition from free to paid usage
- **ETH Balance**: Direct ETH deduction from user wallets

### Credit-Based Model

Ideal for predictable, prepaid usage:

```json
{
  "creditsPerPrompt": 10,
  "topUpOptions": [
    { "creditAmount": 100, "pricePerCredit": 0.001 },
    { "creditAmount": 500, "pricePerCredit": 0.0008 },
    { "creditAmount": 1000, "pricePerCredit": 0.0006 }
  ]
}
```

- **Credit System**: Configurable credits per AI operation
- **Bulk Purchasing**: Multiple top-up tiers with volume discounts
- **Flexible Consumption**: Variable credit costs per operation type
- **Top-up Flow**: Integrated wallet transactions for credit purchases

## Smart Wallet & Blockchain Integration

Built on **Base Sepolia** testnet with **Privy** for user-friendly wallet management:

### Transaction Flow
1. **Wallet Connection**: Users connect via Privy (supports embedded wallets)
2. **Provisional Charging**: `track()` checks balances and creates pending events
3. **AI Processing**: Your application logic runs
4. **Finalization**: `capture()` confirms charge or `release()` refunds

### Top-up Process
1. **Get Options**: SDK fetches available purchase tiers
2. **Submit Transaction**: User sends ETH to developer's deposit address
3. **Monitoring**: Backend simulates blockchain confirmation (7-second delay)
4. **Credit Update**: User balances updated automatically
5. **Real-time Polling**: SDK polls for balance changes

## Technical Implementation
