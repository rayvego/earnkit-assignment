# Introduction

Welcome to the EarnKit documentation!

EarnKit is a monetization toolkit designed to help developers effortlessly add usage-based billing to their AI agents. Whether you want to offer a free trial, charge per use, or implement a sophisticated credit system, EarnKit provides the backend, SDK, and developer dashboard to get you up and running in minutes.

## The Core Problem

Monetizing AI agents is complex. You need to:
- Securely process micro-transactions without high gas fees.
- Handle different pricing models (e.g., subscriptions, pay-as-you-go).
- Prevent users from being charged for failed AI responses.
- Provide a seamless top-up experience for end-users.
- Track usage and revenue.

## The EarnKit Solution

EarnKit solves these problems with a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture and a simple, powerful SDK.

- **Off-Chain Speed:** All per-prompt charges happen off-chain in our database for instant, gas-free transactions.
- **On-Chain Security:** User top-ups are standard on-chain transactions (e.g., ETH on Base Sepolia) sent directly to your developer wallet.
- **Reliable Billing:** Our `track`/`capture`/`release` flow ensures users are only billed for successful AI operations.
- **Developer Dashboard:** Manage your agents, configure fee models, and view usage logs all in one place.

## How to Get Started
